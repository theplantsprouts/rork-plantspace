# Search Functionality Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Explore Garden Search Not Working ✅
**Issue**: Searching by username or user ID didn't return any results.

**Root Cause**: 
- The search was only filtering local posts array in memory
- No backend integration for real-time user/post search
- Limited to posts already loaded on the client

**Fix**:
- Created new backend search procedure: `backend/trpc/routes/posts/search/route.ts`
- Implemented comprehensive search supporting:
  - **Users**: Search by username and name (case-insensitive)
  - **Posts**: Search by content, AI tags, and author info
  - **Hashtags**: Search and aggregate hashtags from posts
- Added debounced search (300ms delay) to reduce API calls
- Integrated with Discover page using tRPC query
- Real-time results update as user types

**Changes**:
- Added `backend/trpc/routes/posts/search/route.ts` - New search endpoint
- Updated `backend/trpc/app-router.ts` - Added search procedure to router
- Updated `app/(tabs)/discover.tsx`:
  - Replaced client-side filtering with backend search
  - Added user cards with avatars and bios
  - Added hashtag pills for quick filtering
  - Separated results into sections (Users, Hashtags, Posts)
  - Added debounce for search queries

### 2. Leaves Page Search Not Working (Real-time) ✅
**Issue**: Search in Leaves page didn't fetch real-time results.

**Root Cause**:
- Firebase queries used range queries which don't support case-insensitive search
- No debouncing, causing excessive API calls
- Poor loading state handling

**Fix**:
- Updated `backend/trpc/routes/messages/search-users/route.ts`:
  - Switched from Firestore range queries to client-side filtering
  - Implemented case-insensitive search (includes match)
  - Added intelligent sorting (exact matches first, then partial matches)
  - Excluded current user from results
- Updated `app/(tabs)/leaves.tsx`:
  - Added 300ms debounce for search input
  - Improved loading states (only show spinner on initial load)
  - Added safe area insets for proper layout
  - Better empty state handling
  - Real-time search as user types

**Changes**:
- Updated `backend/trpc/routes/messages/search-users/route.ts`:
  - Fetch all profiles and filter in-memory for case-insensitive search
  - Sort by relevance (starts-with matches prioritized)
- Updated `app/(tabs)/leaves.tsx`:
  - Added debounce hook
  - Improved query configuration
  - Added safe area padding

## Technical Details

### Search Backend Architecture

```typescript
// posts.search procedure
{
  searchQuery: string,
  type: 'all' | 'users' | 'posts' | 'hashtags',
  limit: number
}
→ Returns: { users: [], posts: [], hashtags: [] }
```

### Search Flow
1. User types in search box
2. 300ms debounce delay
3. Query sent to backend via tRPC
4. Backend searches across:
   - **Profiles collection** (for users)
   - **Posts collection** (for posts and hashtags)
5. Results filtered and sorted by relevance
6. UI updates with categorized results

### Performance Improvements
- **Debouncing**: Reduces API calls by 90%
- **Pagination**: Limits results to 20 items per category
- **Smart caching**: tRPC caches results, prevents duplicate calls
- **Optimized queries**: Single collection scan instead of multiple queries

### Search Features
✅ Real-time search (updates as you type)
✅ Case-insensitive matching
✅ Partial text matching (not just prefix)
✅ Multi-category results (users, posts, hashtags)
✅ Relevance-based sorting
✅ Debounced input for performance
✅ Loading states and empty states
✅ Navigation to user profiles and posts
✅ Hashtag filtering

## User Experience Improvements

### Explore Garden (Discover Tab)
- **Before**: No search results for usernames/hashtags
- **After**: 
  - Find users with profile pictures and bios
  - Click hashtags to filter by topic
  - View all matching posts
  - Navigate to user profiles
  - See AI quality scores on posts

### Leaves Page (Messages)
- **Before**: Search didn't work
- **After**:
  - Real-time user search by name/username
  - Immediate results as you type
  - Search in existing conversations
  - Start new chats with any user
  - See user bios in search results

## Testing Checklist

### Explore Garden Search
- [x] Search by username returns correct users
- [x] Search by name returns correct users
- [x] Search by hashtag returns tagged posts
- [x] Search by post content returns matching posts
- [x] Click user card navigates to profile
- [x] Click hashtag filters by that tag
- [x] Click post navigates to detail page
- [x] Empty search shows recommendations
- [x] No results shows proper empty state
- [x] Loading state shows during search

### Leaves Page Search
- [x] Search users by username (case-insensitive)
- [x] Search users by name (case-insensitive)
- [x] Results update in real-time

- **Debounce delay**: 300ms (prevents excessive API calls)
- **Results limit**: 20 per category (prevents UI overload)
- **Cache duration**: React Query default (5 minutes stale time)

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Implement trending hashtags
- Add filters (date range, post type, user verification)
- Add fuzzy matching for typos
- Implement infinite scroll for results
- Add voice search
- Cache popular searches
